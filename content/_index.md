When I'm not sailing, I like to [break our home network](router/index.html). If that's your jam, there's more on [GitHub](https://github.com/bschnei?tab=repositories). When I really have to sign something, I do it with this key: [73556fff735f691d](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?search=73556fff735f691d&fingerprint=on&op=index)

Sometimes I put out actual fires or [respond to real emergencies](https://www.columbiagorgenews.com/free_news/a-miraculous-survival-chris-poland-s-cardiac-arrest-story/article_220d8d16-fe47-11ef-b8fe-07e36c5a7146.html).

If you're looking for Larky, she's [here](larky/index.html) :heart:

I build this site with Hugo. [Source](https://github.com/bschnei/bens-haus).
